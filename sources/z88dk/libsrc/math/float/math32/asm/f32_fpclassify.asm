; m32_fpclassify — classify IEEE single in DEHL (z80 family + 8085)
;-------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
; Shared portable source (no exx, no IX, no 8085-only ops).
;
; IEEE DEHL layout:
;   D = s e e e e e e e
;   E = e m m m m m m m
;   H,L = remaining mantissa
;
; Full exponent is assembled without rotating DE:
;   exp = ((D & 0x7f) << 1) | (E >> 7)
;
; Return codes:
;   A = 0  finite number (exp in 1..254)
;   A = 1  zero          (exp == 0; denormals count as zero)
;   A = 2  NaN           (exp == 255, mantissa != 0)
;   A = 3  inf           (exp == 255, mantissa == 0)
