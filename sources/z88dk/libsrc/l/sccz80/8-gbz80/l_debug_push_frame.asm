; gbz80 software frame-pointer chain for -debug (see the 8080 version).
; Net effect: push the caller's __debug_framepointer (2 bytes, between the
; return address and the locals) and point __debug_framepointer at that save,
; so the debugger can walk frames and resolve cdb ,B,1,d records.
;
; gbz80 has no `ex (sp),hl` / `ex de,hl`, so the caller's HL is parked in DE
; while the frame pointer is read and the new base computed with `add hl,sp`.
; Preserves HL; clobbers DE, BC, A. DE is dead at prologue entry for the common
; (SMALLC, stack-arg) case; only fastcall/__sdcccall args passed in DE are not
; preserved across the debug frame here.
